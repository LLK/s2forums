This is a fork of DjangoBB forums, modified to plug into Scratch 2.0.

The connection points are as follows:
* Scratchr2 should have a relative symlink to djangobb_forum in its parent directory, which points to `../s2forums/djangobb_forum`
* It also needs a relative symlink to djangobb_forum inside its static directory `/scratchr2/static/djangobb_forum` that points to `../../s2forums/djangobb_forum/static/djangobb_forum`
* Settings.py should be modified to import `../s2forums/djangobb_forum/scratchr2_settings.py`, so that the necessary settings for ScratchR can be found in this repository. Yeah!
